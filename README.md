Add Statecharts to Odoo models.

The Odoo workflow engine is being abandoned by Odoo SA,

This is meant as a replacement, based on the Statechart

There is no documentation yet. In the meantime here are the
[Odoo Experience 2018](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR9VGsSQUnITdnQq5KRiWnY7o-yERCB8YfnqxzhFW5tFcJ8AzMmIQ1CpLTdEgy5Sz9nx-yQlC0BhyGR/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) which should get you started.
